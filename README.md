# CatalystEffectViewChrome

This project demonstrates how to insert an NSVisualEffectView to the root of the main window of your Mac Catalyst app, to provide a translucent window background effect in a more-robust way than my [other sample](https://github.com/steventroughtonsmith/CatalystTransparentChrome).

The window contents can be provided by UIKit or SwiftUI (as in this example).
